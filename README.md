# Abaqus-CAE-UMAT-subroutine-for-Composite-fatigue-simulation
In this project, we simulated the fatigue behavior of a unidirectional composite material using the UMAT subroutine in Abaqus. The Abaqus .inp file, along with a portion of the UMAT subroutine, is attached. To access the video tutorial for this project and all the modeling files, visit the link below.

Fatigue refers to the weakening or failure of a material caused by repeated or fluctuating stresses over time, even if the stress levels are below the material's ultimate tensile strength. Essentially, it's the process by which a material becomes damaged or fractures after undergoing numerous cycles of loading and unloading.

In composites, fatigue can lead to a range of issues that affect the material's performance and longevity. The key results and consequences of fatigue in composite materials include:

1- Crack Initiation
2- Delamination
3- Fiber Breakage
4- Matrix Cracking
5- Decreased Stiffness
6- etc.

Understanding fatigue behavior in composites is critical in applications like aerospace, automotive, and civil engineering, where long-term durability and reliability are crucial. Engineers often design composites to optimize fatigue resistance by choosing appropriate materials, layup configurations, and incorporating protective measures like coatings or reinforcements.

Finite Element Method (FEM) plays a crucial role in the analysis of fatigue behavior and the design of composite materials to minimize damage. While FEM is a powerful tool, using existing software for fatigue analysis in composites is still complex and challenging.

To address this issue, in this project, we used the UMAT subroutine in Abaqus, which is written in Fortran, to analyze fatigue in composites in a two-dimensional space.
