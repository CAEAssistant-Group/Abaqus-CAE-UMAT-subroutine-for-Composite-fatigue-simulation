# Abaqus-CAE-UMAT-subroutine-for-Composite-fatigue-simulation
In this project, we simulated the fatigue behavior of a unidirectional composite material using the UMAT subroutine in Abaqus. The Abaqus .inp file, along with a portion of the UMAT subroutine, is attached. To access the video tutorial for this project and all the modeling files, visit the link below.
